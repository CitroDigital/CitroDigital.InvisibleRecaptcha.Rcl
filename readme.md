```

12. Configure the Action and Score Properties
13. Default Score if left blank is 0.5
14. Default Action if left blank is the FormName

InvisibleRecaptcha Attribute has two properties Action and Score.

1. Action
  1. reCAPTCHA v3 introduces a new concept: actions. When you specify an action name in each place you execute reCAPTCHA, you enable the following new features: A detailed break-down of data for your top ten actions in the admin console Adaptive risk analysis based on the context of the action, because abusive behavior can vary. Importantly, when you verify the reCAPTCHA response, you should verify that the action name is the name you expect.
2. Score
  1. reCAPTCHA v3 returns a score (1.0 is very likely a good interaction, 0.0 is very likely a bot). Based on the score, you can take variable action in the context of your site. Every site is different, but below are some examples of how sites use the score. As in the examples below, take action behind the scenes instead of blocking traffic to better protect your site.

### Todo
1. Add support for reCaptcha use outside of Kentico Forms
